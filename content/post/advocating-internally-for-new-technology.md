**Changing the status quo** and adopting new technologies is never easy. Whether we are talking about a new database, library or even way of approaching your problems, you should know what your are in for.

<!--more-->

> Of course, your difficulties will be very different depending on the size and culture of your team! 

Do you even want to get started?

- **What are the Benefits?** Whether it is ease of development, transparency, adaptability, performance... A case has to be made.
- **Knowledge:** you should know the manual/tutorials inside and out. For bleeding edge projects, you should have read some of the source.
- **Experience:** before you make everyone adopt something, you really should have toyed with it and it should have proved itself in a non-critical project. Ask around what people think.
- **Trust/Authority and commitment**: can you push this through? 

What will make the project successful?

- [Running code and rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus): **do** things, write code, take responsibility, and steer discussions away from uninformed opinions and towards what brings the most value.
- Don't break things *without reason*. Provide guidance and automation to update/migrate downstream clients/users. **Backward compatibility** is boring but everybody will thank you for it. 
- **Onboarding:** give assistance setting things up. Give advice about best practices. Offer solutions, do the work.
- **Support:** if you've built a consensus and brought people on board, don't waste everything. Proactively check-in with your colleagues, ask how things are going. Treat your your coworkers as **clients**.

At some point you will need to evaluate your project:

- **Be unbiased**: consider all options, give fair assessments, be transparent, and always keep in mind what is most important to your team or users.
- **Feedback**: is huge. Only if you listen can you improve your work, or cut your losses early.


Personally, in every **new project** I try to do two things like I've never done before. Never more, rarely less than two. It's great for learning, and soon you learn to judge things better. Changing **existing projects** and workflows is much more challenging: be gentle ðŸ˜Œ.
