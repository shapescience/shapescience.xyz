## At work
Since 2017, I've been working at **[Samsung](https://www.samsung.com)** as a senior algorithm engineer.
I started working neuromorphic image sensors [[overview]](https://inivation.com/dvs/) [[resources]](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/event-based_vision_resources), and I am now working on our processes: quality, software engineering, collaboration...

Previously, I collaborated with [ECI Telecom](http://www.ecitele.com/)'s CTO, and build cyber/SDN proofs-of-concept.

Back in France, I co-founded a company, Lookies. With my dear friend [Louis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisguthmann/), we  tried to make energy monitoring many heterogenous large buildings easier. Not *that* long ago, I worked at [Quantmetry](https://quantmetry.com), a consulting company that pionneered data science. Other experiences include the digital image specialist [DxO Labs](https://www.dxo.com/), [Rothschild & Co](https://www.rothschild.com), UBS, and the French Ministry of Finance.

*I graduated from [Centrale Paris (CentraleSupelec)](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (MS Machine Learning) and [Paris Dauphine University](http://www.dauphine.fr/fr/index.html). (BS Applied Mathematics).
The French readers may be interested to know I studied at Louis le Grand.*

## Personnal life
I've been living since 2015 in Israel with my amazing wife Chl√© and our wonderful daughters!
