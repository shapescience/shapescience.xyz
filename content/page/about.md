## What I'm working on
The team I'm leading at **[Samsung Semiconductors (image sensors)](https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/image-sensor/)** is focused on "infrastructure" for algorithm R&D. It means we're responsible for improving workflows, our open-sourced R&D platform, internal libraries and applications, continuous integration processed, as well as improving collaboration across teams. **Our goal is to remove toil and help engineers achieve more.**


I started working at Samsung in 2017 as a senior algorithm engineer. We tried to promote [neuromorphic image sensors](https://inivation.com/dvs/) [[more info](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/event-based_vision_resources)]. Along the way I focused on "algorithm engineering", and this effort morphed into a **team bringup the "software engineering" culture into our organization** (CI, reproducibility, everything-as-code, data-driven...).

> Notably, I started and open-sourced a [experiment-tracker with advanced visualizations and comparaison features](https://samsung.github.io/Samsung/qaboard) that helps us develop products like our 108MP mobile image sensor.

## Personal
I've been living since 2015 in Israel with my amazing wife Chlo√© and our wonderful daughters!

## Past
Previously, I collaborated with [ECI Telecom](http://www.ecitele.com/)'s CTO, and build cyber/SDN proofs-of-concept blending data science and optimization research.

Back in France, I co-founded a company, Lookies. With my dear friend [Louis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisguthmann/), we  tried to make energy monitoring many heterogenous large buildings easier. Not *that* long ago, I worked at [Quantmetry](https://quantmetry.com), a consulting company that pionneered data science. Other experiences include the digital image specialist [DxO Labs](https://www.dxo.com/), [Rothschild & Co](https://www.rothschild.com), UBS, and the French Ministry of Finance.

I graduated from [Centrale Paris (CentraleSupelec)](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (MS Machine Learning) and [Paris Dauphine University](http://www.dauphine.fr/fr/index.html). (BS Applied Mathematics), after a prepa at Louis le Grand.
