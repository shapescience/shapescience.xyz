## Short biography

Since 2017, I work at **[Samsung](https://www.samsung.com)** as an algorithm engineer.

Previously, I collaborated with [ECI Telecom](http://www.ecitele.com/)'s CTO, and build cyber/SDN proofs-of-concept.

Back in France, I co-founded Lookies. With my dear friend [Louis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louisguthmann/), we  tried to make energy monitoring easier for heterogenous large buildings. Not *that* long ago, I worked at [Quantmetry](https://quantmetry.com) (data science), [DxO](http://dxo.com) (digital image) expertise, Rothschild (M&A), and the French Ministry of Finance.

*I am a graduate from [Centrale Paris](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (MS Machine Learning) and [Paris Dauphine University](http://www.dauphine.fr/fr/index.html).*
