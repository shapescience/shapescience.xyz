> You have better/fun questions to answer? Please tell me!

## The field of data science
- First question, our skillset traditionnaly belongs to a position called *algorithm engineer* in Israel. Not data scientist. Is there a difference?
- How come you can call yourself a data scientist?
- What is your edge / secret sauce ?
- How did you learn the right skills to become a data scientist?
- What do you look for when hiring?

## You job
- Can you pitch me your company? What kind of projects are you working on?
- Can you wear the "I do big data" badge? (Volume/Velocity/Variety)?
- How do you handle the coding process from prototyping to production?

## Your industry
- **@Meir:** Can you tell me interesting/counter-intuitive things about time series?

## Machine learning
- Is it just magic?
- How important is statistical modeling? Can new generations just cross-validate all the things?
- Can it be automated?
- Words you think mean a lot
- Fondamental ideas
- Preprocessing/normalization/scaling: how do you get it right?
- Favorite underused great tools?
- How do you improve your models / do debugging?
- Can you get away using only open-source tooling?
- Vizualisation: what is important in your day to day? (from prototyping to user interfaces...)

*Thanks a lot for you time!*
