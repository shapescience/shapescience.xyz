Contact me to organize workshops on algorithm engineering, or for consultations on how to improve your R&D workflows.

## Common pain points I can address
- **Pragmatic advice** to help make sense of MLOps/DevOpsInfra/Cloud solutions, decide what to buy/fork/build...
- **Build a roadmap** to improve engineers' workflows, collaboration and infrastructure across departments.
- **Implement solutions** to help your algorithm engineers and data scientists waste less time toiling with the "logistics" of preparing, organizing, comparing and sharing their experiments.
- **Evangilize** the software engineering culture in organizations: reproduciblity, everything-as-code, data-driven...
- **Create a Vision** for infra/platform teams

## Workshop sessions
- **Help data scientists and algorithm engineers be more productive**
  * Refreshers on algorithm development best practices
  * Tooling and automation
  * How to communicate results
  * Cultivating a product-first vision
- **Spread the software engineering culture to algorithm engineers**
  * Encourage everything-as-code, reproducibility, data-driven approaches
  * Transitioning from writing scripts to building systems
  * Help everybody understand code sharing and reuse
- **Focused in-depth sessions**
  * Workflows and CI for algorithm engineering.
  * "Building web applications" for algorithm engineers: from python's streamlit to API and JS. When to make the switch?
  * Software engineering for collaboration and reproducible science.
  * Tour of the Python scientific computing ecosystem.
  * Getting good-enough at visualization.
  * Gluing open-source projects together.
  * Quick wins for C++ projects
