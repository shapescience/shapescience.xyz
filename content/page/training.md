## Motivations and goals
- **Help data scientists and algorithm engineers be more productive**
  * Many companies don't have the ressources to teach junior team-members
  * Refreshers on algorithm development best practices
  * Focus on tooling and automation  
- **Spread the software engineering culture to algorithm engineers**
  * Transitioning from writing scripts to building systems
  * Help everybody understand code sharing and reuse 
- **Focused in-depth sessions**

## Examples of topics
- Workflows and CI for algorithm engineering.
- Python for algorithm engineers.
- Software engineering for collaboration and reproducible science.
- Getting good-enough at visualization.
- Gluing open-source projects together.
- C++ for normal people / software enginering with C++.
- Rapid iteration with R.
